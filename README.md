# Computer Organization and Architecture

This repository serves as a storage and versioning system for the *Computer Organization and Architecture* course at SUNY Ulster.  It is split into two main sections:

* `assignments/` holds starter and demo code for the class' assignments.
* `modules/` holds the demo code associated with class modules.
  * Demos with multiple source files are grouped into sub-directories of the parent module.

These code snippets will be shown throughout the semester as we build upon our understanding on *MIPS* and computer architectures, but you are welcome to look now!
